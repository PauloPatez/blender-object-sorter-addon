# Blender Object Sorter Add-on
This add-on provides a quick and easy way to sort the objects inside a collection alphabetically in Blender. By default, Blender does not provide a built-in way to sort objects alphabetically, so this add-on fills that gap.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release of the add-on as a .zip file.
2. In Blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons.
3. Click the "Install" button and select the downloaded .zip file.
4. Enable the add-on by checking the box next to its name.

## Usage
To use the add-on:

1. In the Outliner panel, disable the "Sort Alphabetically" option in the Restriction Toggles menu.
2. Right-click on the collection that you want to sort.
3. Select "Sort Objects Alphabetically" from the context menu.
4. The add-on will then sort the objects inside the selected collection alphabetically.
